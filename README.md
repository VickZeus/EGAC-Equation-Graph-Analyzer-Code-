# EGAC >>> Equation-Graph-Analyser-Code

**EGAC version 1.0 which was launched on 25th August 2023 with an aim to convert any 
bivariable into its graph and analyse various properties of the equation.**

Here is the user manual : 

**1) INSTALLING EGAC**
   
The user is requested to save text file (ptf1.txt ,ptf2.txt) and python program 
(installer.py) int the same folder and double click on the python program. 
 This will create two more python programs – Equation_Graph_Anlyser_Code.py 
and interface.py. 
 
Now users can either use EGAC by double clicking on the 
Equation_Graph_Analyser_Code.py or by opening the same using python ide.
Though we would recommend using python ide for better interface.

**2) USING EGAC** 

Primary interface looks like this :
As of now Operation numbered 2 is still under development and might be ready in 
later updates; we request our users to use operation-1 and 3 in the meantime. 

Users are requested to read and follow instructions carefully to avoid any 
inconvenience.

The program asks users to enter space separated two strings that will represent 
values at y and x axis respectively. (I repeat space seperated) (user can enter y x 
too). 

Read the instructions carefully to enter a valid equation in terms of y and x only. 
(beginning with y=……….).For coefficients in multiplication with a variable use *
and incase the variable is raised to some power write it as x^power .
Enter space separated domain set. 
The program return a graphical representation of the entered equation. 
Close the graph. To view graphical properties analysis.
As of now EGAC shows x-co0rdinate,y-coordinate, point co-ordinates and instantaneous 
slope alone, primarily because we ran out of ideas , we need your suggestions to make it 
more informative it in our later updates.

Now though we coded the program in such a way that user can always enter 1 to reuse the 
operation but we recently came to know that when entered 1 again without closing and 
reopening the program ; EGAC shows correct representation of the equation but 
properties of the initial entry. We are trying to identify the corrupted code in the 
meanwhile we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience caused. 


Finally to exit EGAC press 3 . This will close the program with a Good Bye and Cheerful 
note from the developer.
